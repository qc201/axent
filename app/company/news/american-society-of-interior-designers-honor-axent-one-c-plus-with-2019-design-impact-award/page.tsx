                ASID was founded over 40 years ago when two organizations became
                one, but its legacy dates back to the early 1930s. As we
                celebrate nearly 85 years of design leadership, we are leading
                the future of interior design, continuing to integrate the
                advantages of local connections with national reach, of small
                firms with big, and of the places we live with the places we
                work, play, and heal. Learn more at asid.org.
