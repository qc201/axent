      "AXENT Switzerland, the world leader in high-end bathroom fixtures and technology, debuted North America’s first intuitive wall-hung intelligent toilet, the AXENT.ONE Plus, at the 2019 International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF).",
      "The AXENT.ONE Plus is one of North America’s most advanced intelligent toilets with the exceptional space-saving benefits of reducing each bathroom toilet’s footprint by over 5 inches. Each AXENT.ONE Plus offers a completely personalized cleansing experience complete with custom rear to front shower cleansing, ultra-hygienic hands-free seat and lid opening/closing, seat warming, a discreet deodorizer, a warm air dryer, and an ambient night light.",
      "Bathroom floors and floor-standing conventional toilets are magnets for dust, grime and germs. The AXENT.ONE Plus wall-hung intelligent toilet eliminates this surface build-up by mounting the toilet to the bathroom wall rather than the floor to create a more spacious and easy-to-clean environment. Each wall-hung toilet’s tank is mounted into a supporting frame that is contained in a bathroom wall to free up more than 5 inches of valuable bathroom real estate. This frame also supports the toilet’s bowl so that it may “hang” off of the wall, almost as if it’s floating. The AXENT.ONE Plus offers aesthetic appeal, cutting-edge hygiene, and the highest level of sanitary cleanliness thanks to its exceptional engineering and hidden tank.",
      "The AXENT.ONE Plus was also proudly honored with the ASID’s 2019 Impact Award nomination for its environmental efficiency. The AXENT.ONE Plus requires over 25% less ceramic and water waste than traditional floor-mounted toilets. This material savings is surpassed by the AXENT.ONE Plus’ environmentally-friendly bidet cleansing features which reduce user dependency on landfill-clogging toilet paper.",
      "To experience the AXENT.ONE Plus wall-hung intelligent toilet first-hand, visit AXENT’s booth #2071 at ICFF May 19th – 22nd, contact your local showroom, or contact our expert sales team at info@axentproducts.com",
