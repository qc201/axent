        At the heart of AXENT’s latest innovations is the Novia Collection, a product line driven by the principles of user-centric design and seamless technological integration. Chief Design Officer Arthur Eisenkrein highlighted the philosophy behind the collection: “Our main focus is our customers – caring and beauty are at the core of Novia. We are a technology-driven company, but technology means nothing without design. It goes hand in hand.” He further elaborated on the growing trend of all-in-one bidets and intelligent shower toilets, emphasizing how AXENT prioritizes user experience over technological complexity. “Technology should be behind the wall or inside the product, enhancing comfort rather than overwhelming the user,” Eisenkrein noted.

      <div className="news-content pt-10 font-thin text-lg">
        A key trend highlighted by AXENT at KBIS 2025 is the growing demand for personalized design in bathroom aesthetics. “We’re starting to integrate color because designers are tired of white,” Dagarin observed. “They want to do something different, and this is great for our market and company.” This shift toward customization aligns with AXENT’s broader vision of combining technological sophistication with adaptable, stylish solutions for modern consumers.
