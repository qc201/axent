        Building on the enthusiasm from previous years, AXENT returns to KBIS
        with a range of innovative products designed to enhance modern living.
        Among the highlights is the award-winning AXENT.ONE C Plus intelligent
        toilet, which offers features such as rear and front cleansing,
        adjustable seat warming, warm-air drying, an intuitive nightlight, and a
        convenient remote control. Users can also operate the toilet via a
        mobile app, providing three distinct methods of controlâ€”a notable
        advantage over competitors.
